run 'ng serve --o' this wil open the project in a new window in the browser, if it is not opening, then in the terminal you can see a address for the local server,
go to that, by default it is 'http://localhost:4200/'. but if it is already used, then you can see the address in the terminal window where you have run the command.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
